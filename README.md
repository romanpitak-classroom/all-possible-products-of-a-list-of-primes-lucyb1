# All Possible Products of a List of Primes

You are given a list of primes.
Output a list of all possible products of them.

From [Math âˆª Code by Sahand Saba](http://sahandsaba.com/interview-question-facebook-primes.html)

1. implement it
2. implement it using list comprehention
3. implement it using recursion

nr. 1 in result can be there, does not have to
-> decide one way
